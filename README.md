# Automatic Update and Upgrade Script with Reboot

This script automatically updates and upgrades the Linux distro system using Apt. It checks if a reboot is required after upgrading and, if necessary, reboots the system.

### Features
- **Daily updates**: Runs `apt update` and `apt full-upgrade`.
- **Cleanup**: Removes obsolete packages to save space.
- **Automatic reboot**: Reboots the system if a reboot is required.
- **Automatic cron job**: Checks and adds a daily cron job if itâ€™s not already present, running the script every day at midnight.
